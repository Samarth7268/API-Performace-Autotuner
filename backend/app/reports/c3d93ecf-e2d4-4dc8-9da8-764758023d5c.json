    "Here are some short optimization advice based on the API performance report:",
    "Median latency is relatively high (210ms). Consider optimizing database queries or reducing compute-intensive operations to improve responsiveness.",
    "P95 and P99 latencies are close, indicating a significant portion of requests may be waiting for resources. Investigate potential bottlenecks in your application's workflow.",
    "RPS is low (9.55), which might indicate underutilization of resources. Review load testing results or capacity planning to ensure optimal resource allocation.",
    "Error rate is 0%, so focus on performance optimization rather than debugging errors.",
    "Throughput is moderate (3.39). Aim to increase it while maintaining acceptable latency and error rates.",
    "Note: These are general suggestions based on the provided metrics, and a more in-depth analysis would be necessary for a specific production environment."
